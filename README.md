This repository contains the index.html and styles.css for the fourth freeCodeCamp course certificate, a landing page. For this, I chose a landing page for a Warhammer miniature painting service.

## Description

This certificate builds upon previous html and css skills from previous courses. In this I have used CSS grids, a sticky navbar and a media query.

The landing page contains a nav bar at the top of the viewport to help the user navigate the page. There is a section to enter your email.

This is followed by a section showcasing the different levels of painting service offered by the company. A video showcasing a large project from the company. And lastly the pricing options available to the user.
